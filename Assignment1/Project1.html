                <p>
                    This project involved designing and developing a personal technical portfolio 
					website using the Wix website builder. The goal of the website was to present my 
					resume, academic projects, and technical skills in a clear and professional format
					. The site was structured to be easy to navigate and visually organized, allowing visitors 
					to quickly access information about my background, experience, and projects. Throughout
					the process, I focused on layout design, content organization, and usability to ensure
					the website effectively communicates my qualifications.
